# sibtrio
A sibling project about a roguelike game.

## Here's a map!

- Demo's
Contains smaller project used as learning experiences relevant for this project. Include anything we may wish to re
cycle or learn from.

- SIBLINGS rock
Contains the core of the project.

## Design Goals
With SIBLINGS rock we want to enable the following.

- have a space where each of us can express any creativity we wish
- share, learn and teach our specific capacities
- develop at our own pace independently with no pressure

## Implementation
To achieve the above we've chosen to design a roguelike game. This because we can at any time independently add levels, items, characters or narratives. To achieve this design style where the software always works and each piece works independently we will use certain design practices.
